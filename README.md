- `multer`: Middleware for handling file uploads.
- `nodemailer`: Library for sending emails, potentially useful for notifications or password reset functionalities.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Set up environment variables by creating a `.env` file and adding necessary configurations (e.g., MongoDB connection string, JWT secret,port).
4. Run the server with `npm start`.
5. Your backend server is now running and ready to handle requests from the frontend!
